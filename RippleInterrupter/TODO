[TODO]
1. Separate smoothing for bin occupancy and spikes in each bin. Current scheme,
where only the final place fields are smoothed seems inadequate - produces very
patchy results.

2. Separate bin sizes for position binning and place fields. Velocity
thresholding requires us to has small bins for position, but it might be too
fine grained for place fields.

3. Running ripple detection as a 'thread' makes spike collection and place
binning very slow. It probably leads to spike listener be scheduled less
frequently.
